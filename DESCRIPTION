Description: This package provides utilities for clustering using Dirichlet Process mixture models using Julia for backend computation. 
    It supports a number of existing conjugate distribution pairs, as well as user-specified distributions. Currently, the package only 
    supports clustering using conjugate distributions using the methods in Markov Chain Sampling Methods for Dirichlet Process Mixture 
    Models by Radford Neal. Clustering using non-conjugate distributions is under active development.
    Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. This package is based on the Julia package
    DirichletMixtureModels (see https://github.com/krylea/DirichletMixtureModels.jl), which is being co-developed alongside this package.
