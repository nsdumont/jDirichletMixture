\usage{
\method{dmm.cluster}{RModel}(model, Xdata, alpha = 1, m_prior = 3,
  m_post = 3, iters = 5000, burnin = 200, shuffle = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object returned by \code{dmm.model()}.}

\item{Xdata}{A 1D array of length N (univariate case) or 2D array of size N-by-d (mulitvariate case),
where d is the dimensionailty of the data and N is the number of observations.}

\item{alpha}{A float. The concentration parameter. Default is 1.0.}

\item{m_prior}{An integer. Optionally paramter only used in non-conjugate case. Default is 3.}

\item{m_post}{An integer. Optionally paramter only used in non-conjugate case. Default is 3.}

\item{iters}{An integer. Number of iterations. Default is 5000.}

\item{burnin}{An integer. Amount of burn-in. Default is 200.}

\item{shuffle}{A logical. Whether or not to shuffle the data. Default is true.}
}
\value{
A list of states (i.e. \code{state = states[[i]]}). A state is itself a list.
A state has two fields: \code{labeledData} and \code{clusterInfo}.

\code{labeledData} is a data.frame of the \code{Xdata} data points and their cluster labels.
\code{clusterInfo} is either a list or a data.table (if the data.table package is loaded by the user). It conatins
(1) cluster labels, (2) the number of data points (i.e. population) of each cluster, and (3) all of the parameters for each cluster.

\description{
Use a Dirichlet Mixture Model on data to get cluster labels and cluster parameter values.
}
\details{
Performs \code{iters} iterations of Algorithm 2 (in conjugate case) or Algorithm 8 (in non-conjugate case) from Neal(2000) to generate possible
clusters for the data in \code{Xdata}, using the model in \code{model}, with concentration
parameter \code{alpha}. In the 1D case, \code{Xdata} is assumed to be a 1D array of floats. In
the 2D case, \code{Xdata} is assumed to be a dxN array of floats, where the data is
d-dimensional and N is the number of datapoints.
Returns a list of states. The elements of the list are all states
post-burnin iteration, with the default being a \code{burnin} of 200. By default, this
array is shuffled so that it may be used to approximate I.I.D draws from the
posterior.

A single state from the returned list of states has fields \code{data} and \code{clusters}. \code{data} is a dataframe consisting of the \code{Xdata} and their cluster labels.
\code{clusters} is a data.table (is the user has the data.table package loaded) or a list.

If clusters is a data.table, each row refers to a cluster. Columns are the cluster label, the population, and the rest of the columns are parameters.

If clusters is a list, each element of the list refers to a clsuter,  clusters[[i]] is a list containing of the above information for
cluster i as elements. Each single item in clusters is a list with fields \code{cluster}, \code{population}, and \code{params}. E.g. clusters[[1]]$population is the population of cluster 1. The params field (clusterInfo[[i]]$params)
is itself a list of each of the parameters

To see a formatted summary of all the clusters in a given state use the \code{dmm.summarize(clusters)} function.

To see a plot of the labled data in a given state use the \code{dmm.plot(data)} function.
